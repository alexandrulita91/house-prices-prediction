# House prices prediction
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. Property experts make their house price predictions generally for the year ahead, sometimes for a couple of years.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.6 or 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
- [CUDA Toolkit 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base)
- [cuDNN v7.6.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-base)
- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

## How to install the packages
You can install the required Python packages using the following command:
- `pipenv sync`

## Deep learning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

More details can be found in [this](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf) paper.

## How to train the model
You can train the model for house prices prediction using the following command:
- `pipenv run python dl_houses.py`
